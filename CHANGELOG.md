# Changelog

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- `--format json` output mode for machine-consumable run results

### Fixed
- Run CLI integration tests via tsx against source instead of dist

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-12

There are no feature/fix/refactor commits between v0.2.2 and the current state — just a version bump. There's nothing meaningful to put in a changelog entry. 

If you'd like, I can generate a placeholder entry, but it would be empty sections. Or if there are upcoming changes you plan to include in 0.2.3, let me know and I can draft the entry based on those.

If you just want the version header for now:

```markdown
## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-12
